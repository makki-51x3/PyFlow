**PyFlowOpenCv** 
==================

**PyFlowOpenCv** is a easy to use rapid prototyping GUI tool for OpenCV. **PyFlowOpenCV** enable you learn Computer vision without writing a single line of code, which is great for rapid prototyping and learning. Plenty of OpenCV functions are available as building blocks in PyFlowOpenCv that can be combined in a graphical user interface with just a few mouse clicks. A quick demo on how **PyFlowOpenCv** works for a face detection.

**PyFlow** is a general-purpose Visual Dataflow Programming library. Nodes represent algorithms with certain inputs and outputs. Connections transfer data from the output (source) of the first node to the input (sink) of the second one. **PyFlowOpencv** is a visual scripting extension for PyFlow for OpenCV.

Goal
********

Learning OpenCV is quite challenging for most of the beginners. PyFlowOpenCv make the learning curve of OpenCv much smoother. You do not need to write any code, just drag and drop the diagram. 

OpenCV comes with GUI tools like Highui and OpenCVGUI, but they are far from user friendly. You still need to write a lot of code to use them. With **PyFlowOpenCV**, user can focus on build the computer vision pipeline and fine tune the parameters, instead of writing boilerplate source code.  

Installation
==================
**PyFlowOpenCv is NOT a standalone software, it is an extension package of PyFlow. PyFlow has to be installed first.** You can refer to `PyFlow <https://github.com/wonderworks-software/PyFlow>`_  to install PyFlow.

The easy way to install PyFlow is::

    pip install git+https://github.com/wonderworks-software/PyFlow.git@master

After PyFlow installed through pip or setup.py.
Clone or download PyFlowOpenCV repository to a local folder::

    git clone https://github.com/wonderworks-software/PyFlowOpenCv

Go to the source code folder and install requirements for your use case::

    cd PyFlowOpenCv
    pip install -r requirements.txt


**Option**: if you need to use OCR module, please refer to this page to install the `Tesseract <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki>`_

To run the program in standalone mode, you can invoke pyflow.exe on windows or pyflow on unix OS. Program is located inside PATH/TO/PYTHON/Scripts. You can also 
run pyflow.py in the root folder of PyFlow(not PyFlowOpenCV) project.

You can enable the PyFlowOpenCv package by one the of following ways.

* Copy the PyFlowOpenCv package to .PyFlow/Packages
* User can add location of package to env variable for PYTHONPATH
* Paths listed in PYFLOW_PACKAGES_PATHS env variable (; separated string)
* addition package on preferences dialog. Make sure you add path of PyFlow/Packages under PyFlowOpenCv project to the 'additional package location' edit.

If everything works out, you should able to see 'PyFlowOpenCv' in your NodeBox dialog of the GUI.
